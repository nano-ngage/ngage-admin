# ngage
ngage is the premier app to enhance audience participation for your presentations.

### Summary
ngage has the following features:
- Plan engagement in your presentation with questions you can ask in real-time
- Audience participation only requires a mobile device with internet
- Automatically track audience engagement statistics for any given presentation long-term

### Problem
They key to a successful presentation -- whether it be a lecture-style classroom setting, a workshop you facilitate, or large-scale company reports -- is audience engagement. And the best way to refine your presentation with engagement in mind is feedback from the audience. Getting feedback to improve your presentation is no easy task, especially since the last thing an audience wants to do is fill out a survey at the end.

### Solution
With ngage, you can plan your presentation with interative questions, conceptual discussions, or "thumbs checks" and accumulate engagement statics automatically -- % of total answers for a given prompt, response frequency to a particular question, or (if you have a consistent audience over time), participant-specific answers and trends.
